# ATM_Withdrawal_System
Requirements:

The user inserts their card and enters a PIN.
The system verifies the PIN. If the PIN is incorrect, the user gets two more attempts before the card is blocked.
Once the PIN is verified, the user enters the withdrawal amount.
The system checks if the account balance is sufficient:
If yes, dispense cash and print a receipt.
If no, display an error message.
Finally, the card is ejected, and the system ends the transaction.
Task: implement it using html and javascript
